* MapsIndoors
  * Has been split up into functions on the namespace to align better with dart language standards. Some methods have changed naming to avoid collision with popular method and parameter naming (eg. MapsIndoors.load() is now loadMapsIndoors())
* Changes to the Widget
  * The MapsIndoorsWidget has been changed to be a UniqueWidget, this is to ensure that the underlying MapsIndoors in the platform code can function normally.
